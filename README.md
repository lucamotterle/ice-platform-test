# Thank you for joining our recruitment process.

This project is aimed to show us your technical skills in regards to design, implement and deploy cloud applications. In the following tasks, we will ask you to prepare a simple service which for a given picture answers the question: does the picture present a cat? ðŸ˜€

**Problem:** Does a picture present a cat?

**Input:** Picture file

**Output:** Yes or Not

**Requirements:**

* only consider AWS cloud and AWS/Amazon services
* application is serverless
* application provides any kind of interface to interact with it
* persistence is provided

## Task 

Design a comprehensive architecture and showcase it using a tool of your preference. The application will undergo evaluation based on the following criteria:

1. Network Flow and Security: The architecture should prioritize robust network flow management and incorporate effective security measures to safeguard data and infrastructure.

2. Performance Response: The architecture should be designed to deliver efficient and responsive performance, ensuring quick response times and minimal latency.

3. Cost Optimization: The architecture should aim for cost optimization by implementing resource-efficient solutions and considering factors such as scalability and utilization of resources.

4. Monitoring: The architecture should include a comprehensive monitoring system that enables real-time tracking and analysis of the application's performance, identifying potential issues or bottlenecks.

*Note: Feel free to specify the desired tool or provide additional requirements*

## Result

Push the result in the repo in an encrypted form and share how to read it by mail. The material will be reviewed and discussed during the technical discussion.
